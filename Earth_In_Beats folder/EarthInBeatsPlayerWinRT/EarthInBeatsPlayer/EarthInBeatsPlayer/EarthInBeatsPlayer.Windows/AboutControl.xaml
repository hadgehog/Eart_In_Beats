Earth in Beats Player supports all the available music formats, has a simple and user-friendly interface and what's the most important - it will show everyone on the Globe who listens to the same track right now. You can manage your playlist by just scrolling the planet, create your own custom playlists and watch how the day follows the night while your favorite track rings. If you've seen someone listening to the same track as you do, just zoom that and, you may turn out be the neighbours :)
